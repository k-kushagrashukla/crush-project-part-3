# Magical Moments Gallery
- Magical Moments Gallery is a visually engaging web project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to impress and delight viewers. It showcases a scenic background with personalized photo highlights, interactive navigation, and a playful, charming quote.

## Features
- Immersive Background: Beautiful, high-resolution image of a dog in a lush mountain landscape.

- Artistic Quote Overlay: Presents a romantic and creative quoteâ€”"YOU ARE MAGICAL"â€”adding emotional appeal.

- Photo Carousel: Interactive display of multiple personal images layered tastefully over the background, navigable with arrows.

- Responsive Layout: Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes.

- Vibrant Styling: Uses modern CSS for soft edges, overlay effects, and smooth visual transitions.

## How It Works
- The main background is set using a high-res image via CSS.

- The quote is positioned in a semi-transparent overlay to stand out without obscuring the scene.

- Foreground images (the photo carousel) are dynamically displayed and can be navigated using interactive arrows.

- Minimal JavaScript handles carousel navigation and possible effects such as fading or sliding.

## How to Run
1).Clone or Download the project folder to your local machine.

2).Open index.html in any modern web browser.

3).Enjoy the interactive gallery and feel free to customize the images or the quote!
